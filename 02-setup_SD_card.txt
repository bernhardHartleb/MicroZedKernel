Linux setup guide on the MicroZedBoard - Adrian Remonda 2014

~$ means your pc
target$ the MicroZed

Setup sd card:
--------------

Debian image I have prepare that boots fast (this is convenient when you are  doing some kernel hacking).
Download it and flash it in the SD card with the “dd ” command. 

Download:
6c6297b22fc71387da560a27ed55c0ba  debian-small.img
https://www.dropbox.com/s/76dzekcpdub7pot/debian-small.img?dl=0

# compressed file
https://www.dropbox.com/s/fhpkdzlel790qbc/debian-small.img.tar.gz?dl=0
83366926e00c5f9e78ee620d52a43359  debian-small.img.tar.gz

#uncompress
tar -zxvf debian-small.img.tar.gz 

Check that you have the next checksum with the md5sum command.
Should get : 6c6297b22fc71387da560a27ed55c0ba  debian-small.img

With the command lsblk you can check to witch driver is the SD card (/dev/sdX)

$host: lsblk
$host: export DISK=/dev/sdXXX -> be carefull!!
$host: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=${DISK} bs=1M count=20        -> be carefull!!
time sudo dd if=debian-minimal.img of=${DISK}                -> be carefull!!

Boot the Debian image
-----------------------
Set the jumpers to boot from the SD card:
    JMP1 = "1"
    JMP2 = "0"
    JMP3 = "0"

Connect the MicroZed with the SD card and s
    Insert SD Card into MicroZed. Connect MicroZed to the host with USB
    Serial port cable and RJ45 cable. Reboot MicroZed board (press RST).

3)  check to witch driver is your serial port connected in the host
host$ ls /dev/tty*
        should get something like ttyUSB0 
               
4) host$ sudo minicom -s
        configure with 115200 no hardware and using the previous device

5) You should get a promt with a log.
    Restart the board and you should see the kernel logs

Setup ethernet connection
------------------------

Setup an static ip address in your pc
--------------------------------------
we have to set up an static ip address. If you want to setup permanently you must 
set it in /etc/network/interfaces (write me if you have troubles)
(we can also setup a dhcp server but it is a bit slower).
The debian image has an static ip address (192.168.1.103) as a first step you can just 
do as next in your desktop in order to connect. 

host$: ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.103
host$: ifconfig eth0 up
host$: ifconfig

# the with ping
host$: ping 192.168.1.103

# connect with ssh
ssh root@192.168.1.103

pw: root

        Toolchain
        -----------
        
We will be using the armhf (hardware floating point support)

1)	The first step is to have a linux running in your MicroZed

2)	The second is to crosscompile an user space program and run it in your board

- Download/Extract:

    $ cd
    $ mkdir toolchains
    $ cd toolchains
    $ wget -c https://releases.linaro.org/14.09/components/toolchain/binaries/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.9-2014.09_linux.tar.xz
    $ tar xf gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.9-2014.09_linux.tar.xz
    $ export CC=~/toolchains/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.9-2014.09_linux/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-
    
    or if you have added in the path in .bashrc
    $ export CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-

- Test:

    $ ${CC}gcc --version
    arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc (crosstool-NG linaro-1.13.1-4.9-2014.09 - Linaro GCC 4.9-2014.09) 4.9.2 20140904 (prerelease)

-  To export it permanently
    add the next at the end of ~/.bashrc
    export PATH=~/toolchains/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.9-2014.09_linux/bin:$PATH

-   compile a hello world

    $ ${CC}gcc main.c -o hello.elf


copy the hello world in your board:
---------------------------------

copy the elf file in your board:
host$ scp hello.elf root@192.168.1.103:/root
host$ ssh root@192.168.1.103

# now we are in the Zed
target$ cd /root
target$ ./hello.elf
